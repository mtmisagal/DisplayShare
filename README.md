# DisplayShare+
## Description
**DisplayShare+** is a local display sharing program. The program also gives filters in sharing
The filters include: **blue light filter**, **grayscale**, **dark room** and **zoom**

## Using in Visual Studio
The team used **Visual Studio 2019**. To use these cpp files for a project be sure to include necessary libraries for OCV/OCV2. Refer to the link: https://medium.com/@subwaymatch/opencv-410-with-vs-2019-3d0bc0c81d96

## For Trial
The code does not capture the command for filters well. Use **screencap.cpp** for tial of filters.

## Executing the Code
To use the files run **Receiver.cpp** first and **Sender.cpp** next. **NOTE:** Make sure that you have set the **ipaddress** variable in **Sender.cpp** to the IP address of the receiver. The default is set to localhost.

## MISC
CoE135_OGL, opencv-test, screencap, and texture are previous attempts. You can ignore them.
